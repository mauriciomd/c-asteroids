# Asteroids C

The repository contains a simplified implementation of the [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) classic game. This version was developed using the C programming language combined with SDL.

## Motivation

I was looking for ideas about projects I could develop in my free time and, after reading [Austin's](https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html) article, I've decided that it would be fun to try to develop my version of a classic game. Here are the reasons to choose this project:

- First of all, it's completely different from things I'm used to (web development);
- Second, I really like to play games and I thought it would be interesting to learn a bit about how they were made, even a simplified version;
- Finally, I've wanted to explore a different programming language.

## How to run
- First, clone this repository.
- You'll need to install a C compiler (recommended [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)).
- Install [SDL 2](https://www.libsdl.org/) according to your OS.

After you have installed all dependencies, just run
```
make run
```

## TODO:
This is a work in progress, so there're a few tasks to do yet...

- [ ] Implement the lack of gravity when moving the spaceship
- [ ] Score system
- [ ] Player's life system
- [ ] Sound effects
